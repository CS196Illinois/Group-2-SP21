# What I found

I found different APIs for different social media websites that might be useful for our project.

# How this can be used in the context of the project
These APIs will help us scrape different social media websites and will allow for us to get the various information that we want. Some APIs that I found were for reddit, twitter, and instagram. Some offer more features than others but also have their own pros and cons so those would have to be weighed and decided upon.
