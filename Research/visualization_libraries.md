# Research Frontend

I found some potential tools we can use for representing our data.

# What I found

I found different visualization libraries for showing data in 2D/3D graphs or other unique ways.

# Data Visualization Libraries:
- Python
 - Matplotlib: 2D plotting library for Python (included extensions to make 3D plots)
 - Plotly: unique contour plots
 - Seaborn: higher level interface with KDE-based visualization library, detailed informative plots
 - ggplot: less customizable graphs
 - Altair: automatic plotting provided little code
- Javascript (from: https://blog.bitsrc.io/11-javascript-charts-and-data-visualization-libraries-for-2018-f01a283a5727)
 - D3js
  - Example gallery: https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery
 - Chartjs
 - ThreeJS
 - ECharts & Highcharts
 - Metric-graphics
 - C3js
 - React-vis

# How this can be used in the context of the project
Matplotlib is a good option with simple installation and integration into our program. If we want to use a Javascript library, there are a number of options including D3js.
D3.js is the primary visulization library used for Javascript.
